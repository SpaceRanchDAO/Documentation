# SpaceRanch DAO Constitution

The SpaceRanch Constitution represents the Tokenomics, Arbitration, Consensus Structure and Voting Rights for the DAO. 

## DAO Tokenomics

20% of the DAO Token supply is distributed through three phases of the Initial DAO Offering (DAO)

- Pre IDO
    - %5
- IDO
    - %10
- Post IDO
    - %5
    
10% of the token supply is to be distributed to participants in the NFT Membership Program

The remaining 70% of the DAO Token supply will be held by the SpaceRanch DAO, and delegated respective to consensus mechanisms of the DAO.


## Protocol Changes, Updates, and Bridges
The DAO Token holders have the rights to vote to port the DAO Token from one chain to another, if the intent is to upgrade the underlining technology or change the transaction mechanics and monetary policy. 

Furthermore, the token holders have the right to bridge the token from one chain to another.
