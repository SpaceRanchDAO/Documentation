# Structure & Membership

## Introduction 
The SpaceRanch DAO is registered on the NEAR blockchain as a DAO LLC in the state of Wyoming. 

## Councils

We formalized the SpaceRanch DAO with an initial governing council, with members representing a range of expertise across various industries, web3, metaverse, real estate, ai, and space.  This council is responsible for designating specialized councils for the effective management of the organization. 

The councils function with a holocratic methodology, allowing for fluid and effective management of tasks and processes. 


## NFT Membership

The NFT membership is a ranking system which allows engagement in the organization based on rank. Certain ranks have direct governance capabilities with the DAO such as submitting proposals, while lower ranks are limited in participation such as voting.

The ranks of Captain, Commander, and Lieutenant can opt to have their membership represented as a public identifier for the DAO LLC
