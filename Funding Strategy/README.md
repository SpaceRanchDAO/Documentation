Secondary market sales from the program will generate revenue for as long as the organization proves beneficial.

The goal of the IDO fundraising rounds will be to raise the capital needed to fulfill the real world infrastructure development of the SpaceRanch DAO ecosystem.

The capital figures for the fundraising goals represent the costs to develop:

- 80% of the SPCR token supply will be held by the DAO, with an emission rate based on a 500 year period elliptical curve which allows for a deminishing distribution starting at 1% of the token supply per year through bounties, grants and other incentive programs.
