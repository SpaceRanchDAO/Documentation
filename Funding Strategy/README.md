# SpaceRanch Funding Strategy

SpaceRanch DAO is the land management organization intended to purchase and operate properties which facilitate space launch, research, development, and tourism, as well as regenerative agriculture and energy production in the state of Wyoming. Our development thesis is to raise funding concurrently with the purchasing of land, applications for launch clearance, and installation of infrastructure for an operational spaceport for vertical and horizontal launch.  

Our primary public funding strategies will incorporate a NFT membership program, and Initial DAO offering. The NFT membership program will begin prior to the IDO, but may run concurrently if all memberships aren't claimed.  

## NFT Membership Program

The SpaceRanch NFT membership program will enable participants to engage with the web3 applications built for the SpaceRanch ecosystem, as well as access to the physical properties and digital immersive environments.

A succesful program will generate $25 million, which will be the necessary amount of funding to meet capital expendiatures for the purchase and development of the SpaceRanch.   

Up to 10% of the SPCR token supply will be distributed to the SpaceRanch NFT members proportional to rank. 

## SpaceRanch Initial DAO Offering, SPCR IDO

- https://github.com/SpaceRanchDAO/Documentation/tree/main/Funding%20Strategy/Initial%20DAO%20Offering

The SPCR IDO intends to crowdfund and pool resources from participants by distributing governance tokens - SPCR - through a multi phase Initial DAO Offering (IDO).  

SPCR is a multi-utility token which primarily represents voting rights for the land management and operations of the SpaceRanch.
